#day 16 
# 1.Find the first non-repeating character in a string
# word = input("Enter the string ")
# dic = {}
# for letter in word:
#     dic[letter] = dic.get(letter,0) + 1
# for key,value in dic.items():
#     if value == 1:
#         print(f"{key}:{value}")
#         break# only one which appear for the first time no only non repeating that's diff

# 2. Build a frequency table from a list of tuples
# data = [
#     ("apple", 3),
#     ("banana", 2),
#     ("apple", 5),
#     ("mango", 1),
#     ("banana", 4),
#     ("mango", 3),
#     ("apple", 2),
#     ("cherry", 7),
#     ("banana", 1),
#     ("cherry", 3)
# ]
# dic = {}
# for key,value in data:
#     dic[key] = dic.get(key,0) + value
# for key,value in dic.items():
#     print(f"{key}:{value}")

# 3. Sum of digits of a number until it becomes single digit
num = int(input("Enter the number "))#used string or type casting in solution
# while num >= 10:
#     total = 0
#     for d in str(num):
#         total += int(d)
#     num = total
# print(num)
#Math version is more prefered
while num >=10:# for this single digit problem this is the edge case num range = 0-9
    total = 0
    temp = num
    while temp > 0:
        total += temp % 10 # reducing extra variable reminder clean code
        temp = temp // 10
    num = total
print(num)
print(total)
